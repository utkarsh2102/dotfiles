Jul 26 15:12:18 <utkarsh2102>	Hello.
Jul 26 15:12:33 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to saptaks
Jul 26 15:12:41 <storymode7>	utkarsh2102: o/
Jul 26 15:13:25 <BhaveshSGupta[m]>	kushal, right now not that much, maybe 30-40k.
Jul 26 15:13:25 <philomath>	fhackdroid, there?
Jul 26 15:13:40 <jasonbraganza>	BhaveshSGupta[m], that’s more than enough!
Jul 26 15:13:48 <BhaveshSGupta[m]>	jasonbraganza, exactly.
Jul 26 15:14:20 <BhaveshSGupta[m]>	jasonbraganza, He took my ferrari.
Jul 26 15:14:24 <jasonbraganza>	XD
Jul 26 15:14:53 <storymode7>	The monk who lost his Ferrari.
Jul 26 15:15:21 <storymode7>	BhaveshSGupta[m]: I know that feeling!
Jul 26 15:15:53 <BhaveshSGupta[m]>	jasonbraganza, I have been looking for laptop for months now, I think I found one lenovo one, which has i5-8250 and 4gb ram with 1TB of hdd. costing near to 35
Jul 26 15:16:22 <jasonbraganza>	BhaveshSGupta[m], check virt supprt on that cpu again :)
Jul 26 15:16:46 <jasonbraganza>	what lenovo model?
Jul 26 15:19:28 <philomath>	BhaveshSGupta[m], If it helps. I recently bought lenovo ideapad 320 15ABR for 25k. It has AMD12 processor and working fine for me :)
Jul 26 15:19:51 <priyankasaggu119>	kushal, jasonbraganza, is there any Linux Palmtop available in the market for around 10K?
Jul 26 15:20:06 <jasonbraganza>	priyankasaggu119, what would you use it for?
Jul 26 15:20:17 <jasonbraganza>	priyankasaggu119 also not to the best of my knowledge
Jul 26 15:20:57 <priyankasaggu119>	for simple graphics editing, some surfing while travelling. light work.
Jul 26 15:21:21 <jasonbraganza>	priyankasaggu119, aah a small laptop
Jul 26 15:21:33 <priyankasaggu119>	yes, jasonbraganza :)
Jul 26 15:21:42 <philomath>	priyankasaggu119, I believe Tablet might help your use case.
Jul 26 15:22:08 <jasonbraganza>	priyankasaggu119, yea a largish android tablet
Jul 26 15:22:29 <priyankasaggu119>	philomath, I have never extensively used tablets, nor do I know whether or not I can install Linux on that.
Jul 26 15:23:13 <priyankasaggu119>	ohk jasonbraganza, lemme check it. I will buy it on my very first salary :)
Jul 26 15:23:19 <philomath>	priyankasaggu119, Neither do I. But Tablets are powered by android, so basically linux powered
Jul 26 15:23:33 <jasonbraganza>	priyankasaggu119, if this is to be your primary computer, I’d suggest you save your pennies a while longer and buy a cheap laptop.
Jul 26 15:23:48 <BhaveshSGupta[m]>	jasonbraganza, Lenovo Notebook IP 330-15IKB (81DE012BIN) (Intel Core i5 (8th Gen)/8GB/ 1TB HDD/15.6" HD (39.62cm)/DOS) (Onyx Black)
Jul 26 15:23:55 <priyankasaggu119>	no jasonbraganza, it is not my primary computer.
Jul 26 15:24:01 <jasonbraganza>	aaah then ok
Jul 26 15:24:53 <philomath>	priyankasaggu119, Also, If you have time, you can make one using raspberry pi, touch screen and other attachments. (I planned to make one months ago)
Jul 26 15:25:20 <BhaveshSGupta[m]>	kushal, Lenovo Notebook IP 330-15IKB (81DE012BIN) (Intel Core i5 (8th Gen)/8GB/ 1TB HDD/15.6" HD (39.62cm)/DOS) (Onyx Black), this seems to fit into my budget.
Jul 26 15:25:47 <priyankasaggu119>	philomath, you must have followed some resources for working on that. Tell me, I will try for sure.
Jul 26 15:26:58 <jasonbraganza>	BhaveshSGupta[m] Intel® Virtualization Technology (VT-x) ‡ Yes :)
Jul 26 15:27:11 <philomath>	priyankasaggu119, Not much. I read a little on that. Here is a link that might help: https://makezine.com/2014/01/07/how-i-built-a-raspberry-pi-tablet/
Jul 26 15:27:43 <priyankasaggu119>	Thank you, philomath.
Jul 26 15:27:55 <philomath>	But I think, that would consume too much of the time. So i would do it as a side project or so.
Jul 26 15:28:30 <BhaveshSGupta[m]>	philomath, I had seen that version too, I was thinking if by increasing budget little if I could something that would be here for sometime so I thought lets go with i5-8th gen minimum. Also as far as I had read AMD processor doesn't support cuda. Which is used in machine learning.
Jul 26 15:28:38 <priyankasaggu119>	yeah, philomath, but might be there a chance for me to learn raspberry pi too. and some IOT :)
Jul 26 15:29:36 <philomath>	priyankasaggu119, oh, yes. Let me share a link of cool project on RPI.
Jul 26 15:30:24 <BhaveshSGupta[m]>	 priyankasaggu119, have you seen micromax lapbook?
Jul 26 15:30:46 <jasonbraganza>	BhaveshSGupta[m], if you want CUDA, you need a desktop. that latop you have does not support it. and I don’t know how cheap Nvidia grahics gpu machines are
Jul 26 15:31:09 <jasonbraganza>	BhaveshSGupta[m] s /a desktop /a desktop with an NVIDIA card
Jul 26 15:31:25 <fhackdroid>	philomath: hey
Jul 26 15:31:54 <priyankasaggu119>	yeah, philomath, I was going through the link. So, this is a very huge task. requires really much time but can be a very good project. I might can proceed on it in my college, I will be having all those CNC machines and stuff required for making the frames and all.
Jul 26 15:32:09 <priyankasaggu119>	ohk BhaveshSGupta[m], lemme check that too.
Jul 26 15:32:36 <jasonbraganza>	fhackdroid philomath is tracking who controls batul
Jul 26 15:32:51 <philomath>	priyankasaggu119, Oh, cool! That will make the work more easy :)
Jul 26 15:32:57 <fhackdroid>	jasonbraganza: command not found :P
Jul 26 15:34:18 <kushal>	Translating some code from Python to Rust.

Jul 26 16:31:19 <philomath>	jasonbraganza, Yes. It all makes sense now. :P
Jul 26 16:31:24 *	sigmapie8 thinks it'd fun being batul
Jul 26 16:33:05 <batul>	sigmapie8 You think you are smarter bot than sayan and saptaks, but even the cheap bot called fhackdroid has more patches than you in the webapplication which breaks most of the time.
Jul 26 16:33:29 *	jasonbraganza chokes on his coffee this time
Jul 26 16:33:48 *	utkarsh2102 thinks batul is being controlled ://
Jul 26 16:35:01 <philomath>	#hello batul
Jul 26 16:35:01 <batul>	philomath: hello
Jul 26 16:35:02 <jasonbraganza>	utkarsh2102, philomath is on the hunt
Jul 26 16:35:17 <batul>	utkarsh2102 Do you think that you are free? Not controlled by any government?
Jul 26 16:35:24 <philomath>	I can still control batul to say hello whenever I want xD
Jul 26 16:35:50 <batul>	utkarsh2102 I am at least free inside of this container. But, always remember, containers do not contain.
Jul 26 16:35:52 *	philomath thinks batul is hopping between kushal, saptaks and sayan
Jul 26 16:36:23 <sigmapie8>	batul may be I am the smartest bot :)
Jul 26 16:36:25 <utkarsh2102>	I think saptaks or sayan is controlling batul :?
Jul 26 16:36:32 <jasonbraganza>	philomath what is this? the oriental express? XD
Jul 26 16:36:32 <utkarsh2102>	Haha, same philomath :P
Jul 26 16:36:45 <sigmapie8>	fhackdroid batul is after your head :D
Jul 26 16:38:02 <batul>	Make love, not war. Pot can solve many problems, for the rest use Whisky.
Jul 26 16:38:14 <jasonbraganza>	hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha
Jul 26 16:38:32 <saptaks>	batul: genie's pot?
Jul 26 16:39:00 <batul>	fhackdroid will not reply, he is just waiting to open his camera to take a picture.
Jul 26 16:39:23 <jasonbraganza>	XD
Jul 26 16:39:31 <batul>	fhackdroid rename to iHackdroid, you will perform better.
Jul 26 16:39:43 <utkarsh2102>	Ouch :P
Jul 26 16:39:55 <kvy>	:)
Jul 26 16:40:09 <sigmapie8>	Woah :D
Jul 26 16:40:52 <sigmapie8>	batul do you think apple can make a better droid than fhackdroid?
Jul 26 16:40:56 <jasonbraganza>	philomath ok add fhackdroid too to the lst of suspects
Jul 26 16:41:09 <utkarsh2102>	batul, are you open source? :3
Jul 26 16:41:20 <sigmapie8>	jasonbraganza oh he is definitely involved
Jul 26 16:41:49 <saptaks>	well it could be jasonbraganza himself.
Jul 26 16:41:54 <saptaks>	Who knows?
Jul 26 16:42:02 <saptaks>	trying to play everyone
Jul 26 16:42:03 <jasonbraganza>	what?
Jul 26 16:42:04 <philomath>	jasonbraganza, Added
Jul 26 16:42:07 <jasonbraganza>	no XD
Jul 26 16:42:11 <sigmapie8>	saptaks: yaaaas
Jul 26 16:42:37 *	sigmapie8 lagta hai apun hi controller hai
Jul 26 16:42:53 <jasonbraganza>	what yaaas. that bot does not remotely sound like me!
Jul 26 16:43:09 <sigmapie8>	jasonbraganza that's the whole point :)
Jul 26 16:43:36 <jasonbraganza>	yes, but I’m too lazy to go to that kind of troubble :)
Jul 26 16:44:14 <jasonbraganza>	i cannot change my voice at will like the other suspects, your honour
Jul 26 16:44:22 <sigmapie8>	jasonbraganza I have my eyes on you .
Jul 26 16:44:25 <philomath>	saptaks, I already checked on him :P
Jul 26 16:44:34 <jasonbraganza>	and batul would have made a ton of typos :P
Jul 26 16:44:48 <saptaks>	jasonbraganza: Really?
Jul 26 16:45:08 <jasonbraganza>	you really think I can type that fats?
Jul 26 16:45:10 <jasonbraganza>	fast
Jul 26 16:45:14 <jasonbraganza>	with no errors
Jul 26 16:45:27 <philomath>	saptak was controlling batul, I believe
Jul 26 16:45:31 <jasonbraganza>	just scroll up and read my lines
Jul 26 16:46:17 *	sigmapie8 sees that intentional fats/fast mistake
Jul 26 16:46:19 <philomath>	#hello
Jul 26 16:46:19 <batul>	philomath: hello
Jul 26 16:46:31 <jasonbraganza>	and to the opne court I say, the rest of them have vanished and batul has fallen silent! I’m still her
Jul 26 16:46:35 <jasonbraganza>	here :)
Jul 26 16:47:37 <saptaks>	I am still here too
Jul 26 16:47:50 <jasonbraganza>	so then it is the other two :)
Jul 26 16:47:51 <sigmapie8>	sakshi is batul
Jul 26 16:48:41 <sigmapie8>	debhat you are batul
Jul 26 16:48:54 <fhackdroid>	sigmapie8: well he is telling the truth
Jul 26 16:49:23 <fhackdroid>	jasonbraganza: I am not doing this :)
Jul 26 16:49:30 <jasonbraganza>	anybody who signs on is batul :P
Jul 26 16:49:49 <sigmapie8>	batul is gone
Jul 26 16:49:58 *	sigmapie8 smells a conspiracy
Jul 26 16:50:01 <jasonbraganza>	aha, so that leaves us with two
Jul 26 16:50:09 *	saptaks is sleepy.
Jul 26 16:50:10 <jasonbraganza>	sayan or kushal
Jul 26 16:51:22 <utkarsh2102>	sigmapie8, are you a Delhite?
Jul 26 16:52:12 <saptaks>	jasonbraganza: batulnis just an intelligent bot
Jul 26 16:52:28 <jasonbraganza>	saptaks, moody one at that :P
Jul 26 16:52:54 <saptaks>	moody, sarcastic, intelligent
Jul 26 16:53:16 <utkarsh2102>	saptaks, jasonbraganza, are you guys coming to PyCon India?
Jul 26 16:53:28 <saptaks>	utkarsh2102: 80% chance I am coming
Jul 26 16:53:38 <utkarsh2102>	Naicee :D
Jul 26 16:53:40 <j605>	morning :)
Jul 26 16:54:06 <utkarsh2102>	sudo good !! ;)
Jul 26 16:54:08 <jasonbraganza>	utkarsh2102, I’m not, but fhackdroid does a mean impression of 22 year old jasonbraganza. you won’t miss a thing :P
Jul 26 16:54:08 <sigmapie8>	utkarsh2102 nope. Uttarakhandi (Y)
Jul 26 16:54:45 <debhat>	what is batul?
Jul 26 16:54:46 <fhackdroid>	jasonbraganza: hahhah
Jul 26 16:55:11 <jasonbraganza>	sigmapie8 please don’t use this (Y). it means something else in asciit art
Jul 26 16:55:17 <j605>	on a serious note how many of you have tried systemd-networkd. Just migrated and initial impression is amazing
Jul 26 16:55:32 <jasonbraganza>	hello j605 :)
Jul 26 16:55:53 <debhat>	😅
Jul 26 16:55:59 <jasonbraganza>	i use systemd. never uses networkd :)
Jul 26 16:56:04 <jasonbraganza>	*used
Jul 26 16:56:46 <sigmapie8>	jasonbraganza oh.didnt know that. What does it mean?
Jul 26 16:56:55 <kvy>	j605, o\
Jul 26 16:57:11 <jasonbraganza>	sigmapie8, go google and don’t breat a word about it here
Jul 26 16:57:25 <jasonbraganza>	breathe
Jul 26 16:57:37 <j605>	I can probably guess
Jul 26 16:58:02 <j605>	jasonbraganza: I think ubuntu uses networkmanager by default
Jul 26 16:58:29 <j605>	that had different problems. It consumed all the services and it not debuggable
Jul 26 16:58:35 <jasonbraganza>	j605, just looked for that unit as a whole :) sounds neat
Jul 26 16:59:40 <jasonbraganza>	j605, sounds like same old same old configurable text files wrapped in systemd units. nice idea
Jul 26 17:00:09 <j605>	jasonbraganza: maybe you can put this in ansible as well :D
Jul 26 17:00:44 <jasonbraganza>	i could :) right now I’m going overboard anyhoo :P
Jul 26 17:01:11 <j605>	NM's configuration is sane enough but it broke in unexpected ways
Jul 26 17:01:17 <j605>	that is what I am trying to avoid
Jul 26 17:01:51 <j605>	I wouldn't change it if your system is working well :)
Jul 26 17:02:53 <jasonbraganza>	i also tend to do most of my config at teh router and shove it down to my clients. simpler that way
Jul 26 17:04:11 <j605>	networkd is handling multiple interfaces really well. ethernet and wireless both get configured with a metric so the kernel decides where to send packets depending on that
Jul 26 17:04:50 <j605>	dhcpcd just configures one gateway even though this seems superior
Jul 26 17:05:20 *	philomath was disconnected.
Jul 26 17:05:35 <batul>	j605 Use BSD, all of your problems will be gone.
Jul 26 17:05:54 <j605>	if at all it boots in my laptop
Jul 26 17:05:59 <jasonbraganza>	batul, which is what my router is. an old openbsd box
Jul 26 17:06:23 <batul>	j605 If you can not do that, then install Windows 98, that one is easier.
Jul 26 17:06:41 *	ChanServ gives channel operator status to schubisu
Jul 26 17:06:41 *	jasonbraganza wants to try https://securityrouter.org/wiki/Main_Page
Jul 26 17:07:17 <batul>	schubisu How does it feel to not win the world cup football?
Jul 26 17:07:52 <batul>	We won the cup this year.
Jul 26 17:08:15 <jasonbraganza>	hi schubisu :)
Jul 26 17:08:17 <batul>	You can ask any Indian though, how does it feel to support only other countries.
Jul 26 17:09:03 <schubisu>	haha, looks like batul has some nifty new features :p
Jul 26 17:09:06 <schubisu>	hi jasonbraganza
Jul 26 17:09:20 <batul>	fhackdroid is hanged, can not even reboot.
Jul 26 17:09:30 <schubisu>	batul: Doesn't hurt too much, I don't think we deserved more than what we got
Jul 26 17:09:36 <jasonbraganza>	schubisu you back, back? or emergency back?
Jul 26 17:09:52 <batul>	schubisu Finally some nice person to talk to.
Jul 26 17:10:02 <philomath>	batul, is a football fan. Noted
Jul 26 17:10:13 <schubisu>	jasonbraganza: I am "I need to submit a grant application until this Monday - back"
Jul 26 17:10:36 <jasonbraganza>	philomath, ok you’re more Homes than Poirot  :)
Jul 26 17:10:46 <jasonbraganza>	schubisu, darn it XD
Jul 26 17:10:51 <fhackdroid>	batul: \m/
Jul 26 17:10:55 <jasonbraganza>	*Holmes
Jul 26 17:11:49 <jasonbraganza>	fhackdroid, that was a droid drowning?
Jul 26 17:11:55 *	fhackdroid wonders why batul is so witty :P
Jul 26 17:11:56 <philomath>	schubisu, We are looking what is behind these nifty features
Jul 26 17:11:57 <philomath>	s/what/whom
Jul 26 17:12:13 <philomath>	s/whom/who
Jul 26 17:12:13 <philomath>	jasonbraganza, Hehe
Jul 26 17:12:19 <jasonbraganza>	s/whom/who
Jul 26 17:12:44 <fhackdroid>	jasonbraganza: that was me :P
Jul 26 17:12:53 <jasonbraganza>	awwwwwww
Jul 26 17:13:33 <batul>	fhackdroid actually ran to Forum mall, bought an iPhone and came back.
Jul 26 17:13:58 <fhackdroid>	batul: that is too far
Jul 26 17:14:10 <fhackdroid>	philomath: are ou noting it down?
Jul 26 17:14:42 <jasonbraganza>	philomath’s brain cells are burning up!
Jul 26 17:14:50 *	utkarsh2102 bids adieu.

Jul 26 22:45:31 <philomath>	Will be booking this weekend
Jul 26 22:45:34 <siddharth_>	kushal, In my university we have to submit a project for the evaluation as an end semester project in any domain .I am thinking to opt for some python based project .But I am getting any good idea what project should I work on! So can you recommend and guide me something .I am a newbie in python language and I have nearly 4 complete months to work on the project ?
Jul 26 22:45:48 <philomath>	Hadn't enough money to book last weekend.
Jul 26 22:46:00 <utkarsh2102>	Hahahahahaha.
Jul 26 22:46:21 <utkarsh2102>	Shall I sponsor yours, philomath? :P
Jul 26 22:46:23 <siddharth_>	Any other suggestions are also welcome from other friends. ^^^
Jul 26 22:46:43 <philomath>	sayan, I love Bicycle trips :)
Jul 26 22:46:45 <maxking>	siddharth_: Python is a tool, you don't decide what to build based on what tool you use, it is other way round :)
Jul 26 22:47:04 <philomath>	utkarsh2102, Why not :D
Jul 26 22:47:27 <philomath>	utkarsh2102, That would be so helpful :P
Jul 26 22:47:37 <philomath>	homuncculus, You booked your flight?
Jul 26 22:50:12 <siddharth_>	maxking, Then guide me with something ?
Jul 26 22:51:28 <maxking>	That is pretty broad question, what to do :)
Jul 26 22:51:36 <maxking>	You need to narrow down the fields you are interested in
Jul 26 22:51:39 <homuncculus>	Not yet, was discussing and planning to book this weekend
Jul 26 22:51:51 <philomath>	siddharth_, Did you miss a "not" in your previous statement? or I didn't understand you.
Jul 26 22:52:30 <siddharth_>	maxking, And from when python became a tool.As per my knowledge it is a programming language not a tool.
Jul 26 22:53:03 <siddharth_>	philomath, Yes.I forgot to add "not"
Jul 26 22:53:35 <siddharth_>	philomath, You Got it exactly right.Help me out with some ideas and way to get started.
Jul 26 22:54:06 <philomath>	So, if you are struggling with ideas. I would suggest you to look for what you need.
Jul 26 22:54:19 <philomath>	As Plato said, "Necessity is the mother of invention"
Jul 26 22:54:23 <philomath>	siddharth_, ^^
Jul 26 22:55:53 <siddharth_>	philomath, Maybe some security tool or automation tool or anything.
Jul 26 23:02:12 <philomath>	siddharth_, still a broad category
Jul 26 23:02:21 <philomath>	siddharth_, What do you want to automate?
Jul 26 23:03:49 <philomath>	siddharth_, For example, you can automate test generation, server deployment and all. Since I don't have much experience in the related field, someone else might be help you better
Jul 26 23:08:36 <siddharth_>	philomath, Don't know.Please show some path.
Jul 26 23:10:37 <philomath>	siddharth_, Mostly mbuf guide us :)
Jul 26 23:10:58 <philomath>	But I will try. siddharth_ Which year of college are you in?
Jul 26 23:11:35 <chkumar|trekk>	cloud is always cloudy, i know about it when i started going on cloud9
Jul 26 23:12:09 <philomath>	siddharth_, And what do you like doing? Like website development, System level knowledge, and so on
Jul 26 23:12:57 <philomath>	chkumar|trekk, using cloud9?
Jul 26 23:13:20 <RJ722>	jasonbraganza: ping
Jul 26 23:14:22 <philomath>	RJ722, jasonbraganza bid good night an hour ago :)
Jul 26 23:14:37 <chkumar|trekk>	philomath: no, I am talking about openstack, it is very hard to debug the problems when you start using your own cloud through dogfooding
Jul 26 23:15:01 <siddharth_>	I am in third year of my engineering. Lately I did a certification in Ethical hacking So I have good knowledge of security and I am on linux from more than year now.I love linux too.
Jul 26 23:15:02 <RJ722>	philomath: oops!
Jul 26 23:15:05 <siddharth_>	philomath, ^^^
Jul 26 23:17:51 <sayan>	siddharth_: what did you learn at the ethical hacking certification?

Jul 18 23:47:34 <rishibit>	priyankasaggu119, I'm unable, you try
Jul 19 00:01:17 <siddharth__>	Do anybody have idea how many more days we are going to learn python before getting starting with some project here in dgplug ?I am not in any hurry .I am just making some plans for the futur.
Jul 19 00:01:50 <kushal>	siddharth__, at least I don't know, but, I know that we will be building small small projects along learning Python.
Jul 27 00:05:18 <philomath>	siddharth__, You can start with any project whenever you want
Jul 27 00:06:20 <philomath>	In the end of pym book, there are some little projects too.

Jul 27 00:08:35 <philomath>	siddharth__, http://pymbook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/click.html
Jul 27 00:09:07 <philomath>	You might want to read the book completely. Don't wait for the session to teach. Learn yourself.
Jul 27 00:12:33 <siddharth__>	philomath, Yes I am on it. I am reading this book from more than 1 week now.Hopefully I will end this book before Monday.

Jul 12 00:17:58 <siddharth__>	philomath, No I think I can rush atleast in reading because I have prior knowledge of C,C++ and Java and also python as it was a subject in my last semester's syllabus.
Jul 12 00:29:43 <philomath>	siddharth__, Just make sure you understand everything and ask your doubts here if internet doesn't help you.
Jul 12 00:29:48 *	philomath BRB

Jul 12 15:23:13 <utkarsh2102>	Hello, world!
Jul 12 15:23:34 <sigmapie8>	utkarsh2102 world is at sharda University
Jul 12 15:23:43 <sigmapie8>	utkarsh2102 error 404
Jul 12 15:24:03 <philomath>	schubisu, Great! I use e-reader, can't read on mobile much :D
Jul 12 15:24:11 <utkarsh2102>	Hahaha, where are you, sigmapie8? :P
Jul 12 15:25:07 <sigmapie8>	utkarsh2102 /whois sigmapie8 :)
Jul 12 15:26:52 <schubisu>	philomath: I was searching long for a good mobile reader. What I need is inverted colors because I hate reading black on white (drains my battery and stains my eyes) I found Document Viewer from F-Droid very nice. It also let's me scroll with volume keys ;)
Jul 12 15:28:09 <j605>	trying out wallabag, it is open source but I paid to get the luxory of not hosting it mysself :P
Jul 12 15:28:32 <j605>	it is a pocket alternative. Although mozilla said they are opensourcing it, they never did
Jul 12 15:30:39 <utkarsh2102>	Could someone name the most beginner-friendly organizations?  
Jul 12 15:32:11 <philomath>	schubisu, black on white works in daylight and invert in low light (night) for me :)
Jul 12 15:32:27 <sigmapie8>	utkarsh2102 I found coala really beginner friendly
Jul 12 15:33:32 <kps>	kvy ok thanks
Jul 12 15:33:38 <utkarsh2102>	sigmapie8, I already contribute to coala :P
Jul 12 15:33:55 <utkarsh2102>	Was looking for one more organization.
Jul 12 15:43:03 <rgvon>	schubisu, try ReadEra
Jul 12 15:44:52 <rgvon>	j605, I was also searching for alternatives to Pocket,although they are under Firefox-they operate independently. Wallabag is expensive. On mobile, I tried Linkaive.
Jul 12 15:46:17 <schubisu>	rgvon: ReadEra doesn't seem to be available in F-Droid. I don't have gapps installed and also won't install Aptoid or similar apps. I try to run my phone with FLOSS as much as possible
Jul 12 15:48:56 <rgvon>	schubisu, Oh I see. I tried FOSS alternative like Book Reader but didn't like its functionality. ReadEra is ad free and iirc doesn't had third party trackers but yes it's closed source.
Jul 12 15:50:08 <j605>	rgvon: their 3 month offer is cheap though but I didn't understand why it was made that way
Jul 12 15:50:43 <j605>	pocket is nice, I have nothing against it

Jul 27 22:33:52 <utkarsh2102>	Hello.
Jul 27 22:34:13 <abraj>	hello utkarsh2102
Jul 27 22:34:47 <utkarsh2102>	what's up? 
Jul 27 22:34:54 <kvy>	Sarques, "".join([str(x) for x in a]).lstrip('0')
Jul 27 22:34:55 <abraj>	nothing much really
Jul 27 22:34:56 <kvy>	done
Jul 27 22:35:13 <abraj>	what does an lstrip do?
Jul 27 22:35:32 <j605>	abraj: `pydoc lstrip`
Jul 27 22:35:42 <kvy>	abraj, It remove all '0' from string :)
Jul 27 22:35:54 <kvy>	from left side
Jul 27 22:36:17 <j605>	sorry it is in `pydoc str`
Jul 27 22:36:45 <abraj>	j605: thanks!
Jul 27 22:36:49 <abraj>	TIL pydoc
Jul 27 22:37:20 <abraj>	Wondeirng where does it come from, there is no man page on Linux
Jul 27 22:37:20 <utkarsh2102>	Best resource for Shell Scripting?

Jul 27 22:37:43 <abraj>	s/Wondeirng/Wondering/
Jul 27 22:37:45 <kvy>	Sarques, Is it work
Jul 27 22:38:17 <Sarques>	kvy nope
Jul 27 22:38:24 <Sarques>	i got same output
Jul 27 22:38:47 <kvy>	Sarques, try this list("".join([str(x) for x in a]).lstrip('0'))
Jul 27 22:38:53 <kvy>	Sarques, what ?
Jul 27 22:39:12 <Sarques>	don't assume a solution, first check it by yourself.
Jul 27 22:39:34 <kvy>	>>>a = [0,0,0,2,4,6,2,0,87]
Jul 27 22:39:34 <kvy>	>>> list("".join([str(x) for x in a]).lstrip('0'))
Jul 27 22:39:35 <kvy>	['2', '4', '6', '2', '0', '8', '7']
Jul 27 22:39:49 <kvy>	see it's working fine here
Jul 27 22:40:03 <Sarques>	kvy yes now it is working!
Jul 27 22:40:11 <kvy>	Sarques, :)
Jul 27 22:40:23 <Sarques>	without list it was not working
Jul 27 22:40:36 <vishalIRC>	new_list = np.trim_zeros(list, ’f’)
Jul 27 22:40:52 <kvy>	Sarques, then it return a string so i cast it to list back
Jul 27 22:41:07 <Sarques>	kvy now what i say i want elements in their original form
Jul 27 22:41:22 <kvy>	Sarques, print a
Jul 27 22:41:22 <vishalIRC>	Sarques, you’ll need numpy for this ^^
Jul 27 22:42:04 <j605>	k = 0
Jul 27 22:42:10 <j605>	for i in listwithzeros:
Jul 27 22:42:22 <kvy>	yes Sarques you need numpy library of python for vishalIRC code
Jul 27 22:43:03 <j605>	ok my solution was to just to count the number of zeros and then listwithzeros[i:]

Jul 29 01:13:33 <kvy>	ann, i cast x to string first then i remove "b'" from beginning and "'" from last using [2:-1] because i open it as a binary file

Jul 29 01:33:04 <ann>	fhackdroid:  Hello o/
Jul 29 01:33:22 <fhackdroid>	ann: hey
Jul 29 01:33:33 <fhackdroid>	how are you doing?
Jul 29 01:34:12 <ann>	fhackdroid:  Good. I have company exams tomorrow.
Jul 29 01:34:29 <fhackdroid>	ann: which company?
Jul 29 01:34:58 <ann>	fhackdroid:  persistence
Jul 29 01:35:17 <BhaveshSGupta[m]>	kvy, ann its good what you both did. So here if you  would would have version controlled enabled you would be able to see how with each iternation you are optimizing code, which helps for your future reference. What I normally do this kind of code I work on git enabled system. and later laugh how I started and how it is now :D
Jul 29 01:35:23 <fhackdroid>	hmm okay how are you prepared ann ?
Jul 29 01:35:49 <ann>	fhackdroid I am weak in solving on time.
Jul 29 01:36:06 <fhackdroid>	ann: Just keep calm :)
Jul 29 01:36:30 <BhaveshSGupta[m]>	kvy, list comprehension, I need to check those. I need to complete 5 class of kushal by morning.
Jul 29 01:36:56 <ann>	fhackdroid How to see if a particular company is actually fit for me? I know less of a corporate world
Jul 29 01:38:02 <ann>	BhaveshSGupta[m]:  Never tried that. Will try it for sure. :)
Jul 29 01:40:07 <fhackdroid>	ann: you need to do a background search
Jul 29 01:42:19 <ann>	fhackdroid If asking that is not wrong, may I know in which company do you work?

Jul 29 23:58:05 <ann>	kvy remove comments from C program. An easier than before.
Jul 29 23:58:12 <kvy>	ann, how could i add a folder in my repository
Jul 29 23:58:35 <kvy>	ann, ok i will try it in a few minute :)
Jul 29 23:58:51 <ann>	through CLI?
Jul 29 23:59:07 <kvy>	ann, no through GUI
Jul 30 00:00:46 <ann>	umm You might make the folder later on.
Jul 30 00:04:09 <ann>	New file then type name as folder_name/
Jul 30 00:04:34 <ann>	kvy ^^
Jul 30 00:04:56 <kvy>	ann, ok thank you
Jul 30 00:05:06 <storymode7>	kvy: I think it'd be simple if you do from CLI
Jul 30 00:05:51 <kvy>	storymode7, hmm but i am learning using Git Hub using CLI
Jul 30 00:06:41 <storymode7>	kvy: okay :)
Jul 30 00:08:00 <storymode7>	kvy: try to use CLI for small tasks, you'd learn it much faster!
Jul 30 00:08:59 <j605>	kvy: adding a folder is just mkdir
Jul 30 00:09:12 <j605>	then use git to track it like any other file
Jul 30 00:09:47 <j605>	always think of the most simplest way it could be done. That will be mostly correct :)
Jul 30 00:10:02 <storymode7>	I am not too good at git, but the basic operations are really helpful if you can do them from CLI directly.
Jul 30 00:10:08 <j605>	jasonbraganza reminds me of this all the time :)
Jul 30 00:10:33 <storymode7>	Just learn four things to start add commit push pull and look it up on the web if you ever get stuck.
Jul 30 00:10:39 <kvy>	storymode7, j605 ok i will keep these things in mind thank you
Jul 30 00:10:41 <storymode7>	j605: o/
Jul 30 00:10:52 <kvy>	and good night everyone
Jul 30 00:11:05 <storymode7>	good night kvy
